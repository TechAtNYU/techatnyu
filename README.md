=========

A forum to discuss plans/ideas for tech@nyu. 

This should also act as a single repository of ideas for things we *could* do. Because, in the past, we've had a bunch of brainstorming sessions that have often resulted in the same ideas being generated over and over, without them ever being executed on.
