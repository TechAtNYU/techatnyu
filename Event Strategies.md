# Event strategies
This document is an overview of the different goals our programs could acheive. Whenever we plan a new event, we should ask which of these goals is it aiming to fulfill, and whether it could fulfill more.

## Build capacity from scratch, a la General Assembly.
The advantage of this is that you turn a set of people previously incapable of designing and/or producing a product into people who can now work on making products for the rest of their lives. Tech@nyu acts as an enabler in a more meaningful way than it would with other efforts. But, these workshops/classes necessarily require a lot of time and commitment from each participant, which leads to downsides from tech@nyu’s perspective that may outweigh the benefits. First, as most students are unwilling to give such time and commitment, few participants sign up or make it to the end, though tech@nyu’s effort to make the workshop’s happen is similar (and high) whether they reach 5 people or 25. Second, workshops—on their own—don’t lead to products, just skills that can later lead to products.

## Offer just a start.
Give people a start or taste and then the dedicated/hooked will practice and improve on their own. 'Introduction to X' style workshops could be a relatively low­effort way to get new people, who might be too intimidated or not enthusiastic enough to take a formal design/programming class on their own, introduced to the field and ready to continue on their own.

## Play the role of matchmaker.
Most products take teams to create, and finding appropriate teammates (who must also be friends) can be hard. Casual events that bring people together informally to chat and pseudo­work can be a good, easy way to introduce people to their future collaborators. HackNight’s are the best example of how tech@nyu’s currently pursuing this approach. But if the challenge in finding a teammate is to find someone with complementary skills, the participants at these social events must actually have different skills. This may be somewhat true at HackNights (if, for example, it brings together backend developers and frontend developers), but it also implies that maybe these events shouldn’t be organized around a role in the product creation process (i.e. programmer, designer, marketer, etc.) but rather around the type of product (i.e. games, websites, mobile apps, furniture, robots, electrical appliances). That way, everyone who's interested and/or has the skills required to contribute a given kind of product—regardless of the role they’d play in creating such a product—can come together.

## Offer opportunities for practice.
Of course, people improve in their roles by practicing, so encouraging practice gives you some of the benefits of (1), except that you’re not starting with total newcomers. Hackathons (for programming) and workshop­style exercises (for design) are obvious ways to do this. 

## Offer opportunities to learn specific new skills.
These are efforts that target people who already know something about an area but could learn more about a particular. These are workshops like “Introduction to Django” or “Mobile Interaction Patterns”. They’re the types of things that you’d see at conferences for practitioners. They necessarily draw a narrower audience (one must, re the examples above, first know Python or Interaction Design to benefit), but are still useful. And they attract audiences that could be channeled into efforts in (3). These are best offered in conjunction with intro workshops and programs that builds capacity, so that the newbies don't feel their only option is to come to the more-advanced workshops (where their presence might be detrimental/distracting).

## Foster inter­role appreciation.
In other words, give designers a taste of programming and programmers a taste of design with the hope that it makes them more able to communicate and appreciate the other’s role. 

## Introduce protegés to mentors.
Put less-­experienced practitioners (of any role) in touch with more-­experienced ones who are willing to share their skills/knowledge. This might be a tech@nyu mentorship network, or similar.
